In our Python implementation of 2048, we have used Tkinter, a built-in Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). 
Tkinter provides us with tools to design the game window, handle user input, and update the game grid dynamically.

In the provided code for the 2048 game using #Python and #Tkinter, there is one external module being used:

tkinter (import tkinter as tk):
tkinter is the standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit for Python.
It provides various widgets (such as buttons, labels, entry fields) and methods for creating graphical applications.
In the code, tkinter is used to create the game window, grid cells, and handle user input events (such as key presses).
This module comes bundled with Python, so there’s no need to install it separately.
Apart from tkinter, the code also uses the built-in random module, which is a part of the Python standard library and does not require any additional installation.

Here’s a brief summary of the modules used in the code:

tkinter: Used for creating the GUI components and handling user input.
random: Used for generating random numbers for adding new tiles in the game.
