### Project Overview

This Python implementation of the 2048 game leverages Tkinter, Python's standard library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Tkinter is used to design the game window, manage user interactions, and dynamically update the game grid.

### Key Modules Used

- **Tkinter (imported as `tk`)**: Tkinter is the standard GUI toolkit for Python, providing various widgets such as buttons, labels, and entry fields. In this project, Tkinter is employed to create the game window, render the grid cells, and handle user input events like key presses. As Tkinter is bundled with Python, no additional installation is required.

- **Random**: The built-in `random` module is used to generate random numbers, which are essential for adding new tiles to the game grid.

These modules are integral to the functionality and user experience of the 2048 game, ensuring a responsive and interactive interface.
