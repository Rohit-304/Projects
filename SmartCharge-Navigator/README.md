# SmartCharge Navigator

**SmartCharge Navigator** is an innovative solution designed to enhance the process of locating and navigating to EV (Electric Vehicle) charging stations. This application consolidates data from multiple prominent EV charging networks, providing users with a centralized platform to efficiently identify nearby charging stations and receive optimized route guidance.

---

## Key Features

- **Integrated Charging Network Access**  
  SmartCharge Navigator aggregates information from various major EV charging networks, providing users with a streamlined, unified interface to locate stations across multiple providers.

- **Shortest Path Calculation**  
  Using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, SmartCharge Navigator calculates the most efficient route to the nearest charging station, optimizing both route selection and travel time.

- **Estimated Travel Time**  
  Delivers precise travel time estimates based on calculated shortest paths and a default speed setting of 40 km/h, enabling users to plan trips effectively.

- **User-Centric Interface**  
  The application offers an intuitive, accessible design, simplifying navigation, station selection, and access to real-time station availability.

## Technologies Utilized

- **Java**: The primary programming language for implementing algorithms and managing data structures.
- **Priority Queue**: Employed for efficient shortest path calculations, enabling optimal pathfinding.
- **Graph Data Structure**: Models station locations and distances within the network, enhancing the accuracy of route planning.

## Getting Started

1. **Repository Clone**: Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rohit-304/Projects/SmartChargeNavigator.git
   ```
   
2. **Compile and Run**: Use your preferred development environment (such as IntelliJ or Eclipse) or compile from the command line:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   java Main
   ```

3. **Begin Navigation**: Launch the application to explore charging stations nearby, along with optimized routes and live updates.
